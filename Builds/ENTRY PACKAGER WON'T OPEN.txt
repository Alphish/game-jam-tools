To open the Jam Entry Packager, you must have installed .NET Desktop Runtime 5.0.17
Note: just installing runtime for .NET 5 won't be enough, you need to install the Desktop runtime specifically!

You can download the runtime from this page:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0

Since this Entry Packager version was built for x64 architecture, install the x64 version of the runtime.

Hopefully after the runtime is installed, you won't have any more problems using the Entry Packager!
