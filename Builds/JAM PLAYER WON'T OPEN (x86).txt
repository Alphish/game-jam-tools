To open the Jam Player, you must have installed .NET Desktop Runtime 5.0.17
Note: just installing runtime for .NET 5 won't be enough, you need to install the Desktop runtime specifically!

You can download the runtime from this page:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0

Since this Jam Player version was built for x86 architecture, install the x86 version of the runtime.

Hopefully after the runtime is installed, you won't have any more problems using the Jam Player!
